Hello there.

It has been time, since i have made an attempt to update my blog with
the ongoing’s of my life. But now would be the right time probably.

Alot have changed in some months, like i am now a 4th Year Final student
at Jaypee University of Engineering and Technology(JUET), Guna. That’s
pretty bad-ass bro.

And as every engineer need to complete a mandatory training/internship
at the end of the 3rd Year of B.Tech i also did.

In 2015, i attended 
\#[**GopherConIndia**](http://www.gophercon.in/) conference, Bangalore where i met
alot of techies & awesome people. Where there was this one startup, that
at that time were working on a exciting new technology which involved
both hardware and software mashup on their new product called ‘Twist’,
and immediately it was clear to me that i wanted to experience this
work. 

So i got an internship for 6 weeks at
**[RainingClouds](http://rainingclouds.com/)/[BetaCraft](http://betacraft.co/)**
Pune from June to July of 2015.

test painting with 3 points on the screen. That was a memorable day. 

Pune
----

Well, I just loved pune. It was so refreshing, people are so nice, young
people all around. I would argue that pune is probably the best city to
live in india right now, if you are 20+, love life and need work.

With so much to offer pune stands out from other biggies of India like
New Delhi, Bangalore, Mumbai etc. and the food is so versatile that even
a month in pune you would be eating new stuff each day & the tastes are
muah.

Some pictures.
