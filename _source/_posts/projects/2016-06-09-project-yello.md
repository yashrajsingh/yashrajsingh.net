  <p>I started working on a new build for project yello on Jan, 2016. Starting from the scratch, I wanted to fulfil this idea, to let students share around the campus without the fear. Also the power to raise your voice within the campus. Project Yello had always been about the projects within the campus, but it needed to be more, we added social to it.</p>

  <h3>Android Application</h3>
  <p>An Android application for users who wish to use the Project Yello on the go. Modern UI, Older Phones Support. It utilises <a href="https://projectyello.appspot.com/api" target="_blank">Project Yello's API</a> which are powered by <a href="https://cloud.google.com/endpoints/" target="_blank">Google Endpoints</a>.</p>
</div>

<div class="project project-description fit-right width-two">
  <h3>Backend</h3>
  <p>We needed a concrete backend which can scale, if needed, So we pivoted towards <a href="https://cloud.google.com/appengine/" target="_blank">Google App Engine</a> which as a PaaS can scale quickly relaying on Google's server is a good option. The whole backend is written in Python with other App engine services. API's are powered by <a href="https://cloud.google.com/endpoints/" target="_blank">Google Endpoints</a>.</p>

  <h3>Project Yello</h3>
  <p>In June 2014, I started working on Project Yello, The idea was simple. While my time in college, i realized that there is a huge gap between 'what student learned' and 'what student is taught'. The things we were taught in college, were of no use most of the times, because students didn't worked on projects i.e. to apply that knowledge they learned atleast once, so they would get a better prespective of how, why, when, what of that knowledge.You can take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/yashrajsingh/ProjectYello-Desktop" target="_blank">code on GitHub</a>.</p>
