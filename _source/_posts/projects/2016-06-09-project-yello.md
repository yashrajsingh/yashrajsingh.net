  <h3>Project Yello</h3>
  <p>In June 2014, I started working on Project Yello, The idea was simple. While my time in college, i realized that there is a huge gap between 'what student learned' and 'what student is taught'. The things we were taught in college, were of no use most of the times, because students didn't worked on projects i.e. to apply that knowledge they learned atleast once, so they would get a better prespective of how, why, when, what of that knowledge.You can take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/yashrajsingh/ProjectYello-Desktop" target="_blank">code on GitHub</a>.</p>
