	<p>From May 2009 till 2011, I blogged about penetration testing and security for various platforms, there were number of reasons to do so. First, it was a good learning process. I learned and wrote about it. Second, It helpmed me understand the importance of design, programming and a lot of other things in this online world. It was my first foray into web and security. It has over <span style="font-weight: bold;">1.8 Million+ page hits</span>, 500+ subscribers, 2500+ likes on <a href="http://www.facebook.com/hackerthedude" target="_blank">Facebook</a>, 1100+ followers on <a href="http://www.twitter.com/hackerthedude" target="_blank">Twitter</a>.
